<p>Template for features.html is from tutorialsfreak.</p>
<p>Syntax from 18-26 in asg0.js are from ChatGPT because I was kind of confused on how to draw the vector, but I added comments to show my understanding.</p>
<p> Also got lines 37-38 from ChatGPT when I was trying to figure out how to make the vertex components a number instead of a string.</p>
